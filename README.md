# Emergem
"Emerge-a-gem"
A live creation environment that holds an Emernet (Emergence-Network) of Nodes (Generic Signal Processing Units)
Provides an interface for managing nodes, adjusting node parameters, emerging nodes together, capturing nodes, and composing a song/video out of captures

Replace your DAW, and all your synths too

Designed by observing the music within (the experience of conciousness), creating a visual-systems reflection of it, and basing the Emergem's design off that reflection

## Comparison of Usefulness/Capabilities
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d6b261c-2998-4dfc-ad32-cfb59d54427d)
- Emergem is more capable then DAW due to having a generic node graph (free to connect from any unit node output to compatible unit node input). It also has generic polyphonic output/input types for nodes (e.g. audio, control signals, midi signals, gate signals, pitch signals, phase signals, signals for creating visuals...)
- Emergem also provides interface for composing music/videos.. Emergem has a novel interface for capturing parts of or an entire generic graph in time, as well as create sections, and sequence them to create a song..
- Emergem does this all through an interface that is like a feature extended live-looping interface (so it is designed for live creation). (See Kokopelli-Interfaces Vcvrack module "Circle" for an idea)

## Emernet
the design of the Emergem is based on my spiritual understanding of my experience of conciousness

the Emergem hosts an Emernet inside it

## Design Principle
 - Rooted in the emergence of orthogonal components
	- "Sound design via connecting signal processing nodes together, all which do their own one thing"
- Musician focused sound creation, not technology focused
 	 - Functions intuitively mapping to functions in the experiential sound space
- Uses sound language.
- Uses synesthetic visuals for representing the outputs and states of nodes.
- Interacting with a real-time, 'living' system.
- Feels like using an instrument, not a workstation 
  	- (Use touchscreen to control blocks, or use custom physical Emergem Controller)
- One can develop with it as a sound designer/composer
	 - "I can recreate this sound in my head by decomposing it into key characteristics such as: Pitch around C5, Timbre is Nasaly, High Volume, Positioned far in a room and to the left, Dynamics are clipping, Composed of Grains, Fuzzy. Creating this should be intuitive in the interface because it is the language of the nodes in the interface."
