# Emergem
_"Emerge-a-gem"_

A live creation environment that hosts an Emernet (Emergence-Network) of Nodes (Generic Signal Processing Units).  
It provides an interface for managing nodes and groups of nodes, adjusting node parameters, connecting nodes together, capturing nodes in time, and composing a song or video from captures.

Replace your DAW and all your synths too!

Designed by observing the music within (the experience of consciousness), creating a visual-systems reflection of it, and basing Emergem's design on that reflection.

_ignore the "floating nodes" part_

- Emergem is more capable than a DAW due to its generic node graph (free to connect from any unit node output to a compatible unit node input). It also features generic polyphonic output/input types for nodes (e.g., audio, control signals, MIDI signals, gate signals, pitch signals, phase signals, and signals for creating visuals).
- Emergem provides an interface for composing music and videos. It includes a novel interface for capturing parts of—or an entire—generic graph in time, as well as creating sections and sequencing them to produce a song.
    - Emergem achieves this through an interface resembling a feature-extended live-looping system (designed for live creation). (See the Kokopelli-Interfaces VCV Rack module "Circle" for an idea.)

## Design Principles
- Rooted in the emergence of orthogonal components:
  - "Sound design via connecting signal processing nodes together, each doing its own unique task."
- Musician-focused sound creation, not technology-focused:
  - Functions intuitively map to the experiential sound space.
- Uses a sound-based language.
- Employs synesthetic visuals to represent the outputs and states of nodes.
- Interacts with a real-time, "living" system.
- Feels like using an instrument, not a workstation:
  - Use a touchscreen to control blocks or a custom physical Emergem Controller.
- Enables development as a sound designer or composer:
  - "I can recreate this sound in my head by decomposing it into key characteristics such as: Pitch around C5, Timbre is nasal, High Volume, Positioned far in a room and to the left, Dynamics are clipping, Composed of grains, Fuzzy. Creating this should be intuitive in the interface because it is the language of the nodes."

## Emernet
The design of Emergem is based on my spiritual understanding of my experience of consciousness.

Emergem hosts an Emernet inside it:

One interesting difference between the Emernet in the Emergem
and the Emernet in the experience is that two energies do not have to exist at the same point in time in order to have an emergence relationship, emergence  in the experience is not bound by time. 

### Circle of Life
This is the song of the Emernet that plays without beginning or end:
